/**
 * binary_tree_insert_left - inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
 * @parent: pointer to the node to insert the left-child in.

 * Description: If parent already has a left-child, the new node takes its
 * place, and the old left-child is set as the left-child of the new node.
 * Return: a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is
 * NULL.
